Welcome to WifeyMOOC, the super cute language learning application I made for my amazing wife, Sierra\! This app is designed to make learning French fun and interactive, with a variety of adorable quiz questions and flashcard features.  
This project is built with lots of love and comes in two flavors:

Both versions are designed to be engaging, colorful, and perfect for learning\! üíï
