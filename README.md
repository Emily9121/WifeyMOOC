# WifeyMOOC 1.0.2

App used for language learning, due to how it came to exist, no maintenance is promised even for massive bugs, don't complain to me if it kill your guinea pig or something.

Exercise provided for testing/documentation purposes.

AI Disclosure: 100% of everything was made with AI, sorry, while I have personal ethical concern with the tech, it seemed like the best fitting option for what is essentially
a solution for personal use only (that now happen to be public, but only because I want a git repository lol, I don't expect anyone to care!), given those circumstance,
everything is licencied into  DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE , including the example exercise and it's images.

Changelog:

1.0.3 - Fix bug with seekbar in MacOS, Add image scaling support
