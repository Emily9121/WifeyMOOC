# WifeyMOOC 1.2.0

App used for language learning, due to how it came to exist, no maintenance is promised even for massive bugs, don't complain to me if it kill your guinea pig or something.

Exercise provided for testing/documentation purposes.

AI Disclosure: 100% of everything was made with AI, sorry, while I have personal ethical concern with the tech, it seemed like the best fitting option for what is essentially
a solution for personal use only (that now happen to be public, but only because I want a git repository lol, I don't expect anyone to care!), given those circumstance,
everything is licencied into  DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE , including the example exercise and it's images.

Changelog:

1.0.3 - Fix bug with seekbar in MacOS, Add image scaling support

1.0.4 - So what happened is that none of my files tried to use list_pick or sequence_audio, and being this was done by AI, of course the clanker was lazy and none of those question type actually worked... this is now fixed and they work as expected!

1.1.0 - Added support for images in mqc_single/mqc_multiple and added a handy multi_questions block, also improved debug messgaes for image_tagging - due to the usage of a different clanker and some apparently significant code change, it is 1.1 and not 1.0.5. - also added testfile-complete.json to check every question type quickly.

1.2.0 - Added the python version to the public repository - Added support for hint in the json file!
